## Introduction to Data Science Technology  

This folder contains introductory video lectures and slides to familiarize students with principle of Data Science and Data Science Technologies.

## Slides  

**Introduction to Data Science** provides a high-level overview of data science theory. [NEED SLIDES]

**Data Science Process** contains lecture material introduces the process data scientist use to approach problems. There are notes on historical approaches to data mining and data science.    [NEED SLIDES]

**Introduction to Machine Learning** introduces students to the basic concepts of machine learning theory. [NEED SLIDES]

## Labs

Lab 1 - Getting Started with Azure Machine Learning. In this lab, you will learn how to open and navigate the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) Studio. You will also learn how to create and run experiments in Azure ML.

## Data

This lab uses one data set:

The customers credit scores for 950 customers are in *Credit-Scoring-Clean.csv*

The information in some of these features (columns) is in a coded format; e.g. A14, A11. You can see the meaning of these codes on the UCI Machine Learning repository at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data).

## Code

The code for Lab1 are in the following files:

- dropcols.R
- dropcols.py
- selectcols.SQL

## Videos  

Videos introducing both data science theory and practice can be found by following the links provided. 

**Setup**

- **[Course Introduction](https://youtu.be/pRgsssnHfx4)** introduces the course.
- **[Setting up Azure Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/im6zWhDFL9Y)** Shows you somethings students need to know to setup thier environments so they can do the exercises for the course.
- **[Installing R](https://youtu.be/ANua7PtyMcw)** Shows how to set up R Open and R Studio.
- **[Installing Python](https://youtu.be/ZxflRT5vhos)** Shows how to set up Anaconda and Spyder to use Python to do the exercises

**Foundationa and Concepts**

- **[Data Analytic Thinking](https://youtu.be/a67awjtgEJU)** Talks about  data analytic thinking which is a process whereby organizations think about their data assets and use those assets to transform how they do whatever it is they do.
- **[The Data Science Process](https://youtu.be/9Y_K49SA4YY)**  Talks about the data science process and in particular gives historical notes on the KDD process, the CRISP-DM process, Big Data and Data Science and their relationships to Data Mining and Machine Learning.
- **[An Overview of Data Science Technology](https://youtu.be/bmXL5ZYQzy8)** Gives a broad overview of data science technology, including the technologies used in this course.

**Azure ML**

- **[Azure Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/udw7GcZSlpA)** Talks about Azure Machine Learning and why the reasons for using it.
- **[Using Code in Azure ML](https://youtu.be/6aOs8Jgvqdw)** Continues with building the experiment from the previous video and adds some custom Python, R and SQL code in modules to that workflow.
- **[Using R in Jupyter Notebooks](https://youtu.be/jzzO84eWNRE)** A demo that shows a very cool feature of Azure Machine Learning, namely the ability to open and work with data sets using a Jupiter notebook with an R kernel.
- **[Using Python in Jupyter Notebook](https://youtu.be/yqK9czQS_oE)** A demo that shows a very cool feature of Azure Machine Learning, namely the ability to work with your data from your experiment in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.
- **[Creating a Machine Learning Model](https://youtu.be/RgjCvGbmaEE)** Complete the experiment from the previous video by adding a machine learning model.
