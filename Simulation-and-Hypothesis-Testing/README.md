README for Simulation and Hypothesis Testing
# Data Science Essentials   
## Module 3: Simulation and Hypothesis Testing

This folder contains introductory video lectures and slides to familiarize students with running simulations that model large quantities of data and core data science skills including working with confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to understand the statistical likelihood of the conclusions drawn from the data. 

## Slides  

**SLIDE 1**  [NEED SLIDES]

**SLIDE 2**  [NEED SLIDES]

**SLIDE 3**  [NEED SLIDES]

## Labs

**Lab 3 - Simulation** 

In this lab, you will learn how to create, run and interpret simulations using R or Python. Simulation is
widely used in cases where estimates are required from complex distributions of values or a hierarchy of
distributions.

## Data

This lab does not use an data sets.

## Code

The code for Lab1 are in the following files:

- restsim.R
- restsim.py

## Gallery

**Lab 3** full solution can be found in the Azure ML Gallery

- Solution 1 [Need Link]
- Solution 2 [Need Link]

## Videos  

Videos introducing simulations as well as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing can be found by following the links provided.
