# Data Science Essentials   
## Module 2: Probability and Statistics for Data Science 

This folder contains introductory video lectures and slides to familiarize students with principles of random variables and probability calculations, as well as discrete and continuous random distributions.

## Slides  

**SLIDE 1**  [NEED SLIDES]

**SLIDE 2**  [NEED SLIDES]

**SLIDE 3**  [NEED SLIDES]

## Labs

**Lab 2 - Working with Summary Statistics** 

In this lab you will learn how to use either R or Python to compute and understand the basics of descriptive statistics, which will allow you understand a data set.

## Data

This lab uses one data set:

Automobile prices for 205 vehicles are in *Automobile price data_Raw_.csv*

The information in some of these features (columns) is in a coded format; e.g. A14, A11. You can see the meaning of these codes on the UCI Machine Learning repository at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data).

## Code

The code for Lab1 are in the following files:

- Stats.R
- Stats.py

## Gallery

**Lab 2** full solution can be found in the Azure ML Gallery

- Solution 1 [Need Link]
- Solution 2 [Need Link]
